## Overview

This repo consists of some useful codes that was developed as part of some activities in a course on Apache Spark that I took in Udemy. I have had prior experience dealing with all the these (except breadth-fast-search and streaming data) albeit in a non-distributed context. It was really interesting to apply these methods to large datasets (even on my personal computer) using spark RDDs and dataframe framework. It was quite interesting to get to know the breadth-fast-search algorithm and apply it to find the degree of separation in a social graph. Apart from these, I also tried my hands on dealing with streaming data.   


## Projects
